## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## How it works
The inventory system in Java is an application that allows you to manage a company's product inventory. It uses the HashMap data structure to store the items and their quantities. The system has features such as adding items to stock, removing items from stock and displaying the complete stock.

When adding an item, the system checks if it already exists in stock. If yes, update the quantity. Otherwise, add the item with the informed quantity. When removing an item, the system verifies that it exists and that the requested quantity does not exceed the available one. If so, update the quantity. Otherwise, it displays an error message.

The system also allows displaying the complete inventory, showing each item and its respective quantity. If the stock is empty, it displays a message informing you of this. Interaction with the user is done through the Scanner class, where the user can inform the desired operations.

In summary, the inventory system in Java is a simple and efficient tool for managing a company's inventory, allowing you to add, remove and view items with their corresponding quantities.
